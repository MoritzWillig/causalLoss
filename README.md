# The Causal Loss: A Na√Øve Causal-Neural Connection

# Abstract

Most algorithms in classical and contemporary machine learning are trained to estimate features in correlation-based settings. Although success has been observed in many relevant problems, these algorithms are not guaranteed to perform well when the model is either oblivious to the underlying causal structure or inconsistent with its implied causal relations. Recent works have proposed different parameterizations of causal models in the Pearlian notion of causality, one of them being based on Probabilistic Circuits (PCs). In this work we show that by leveraging PCs as density estimators with tractable inference properties we can teach classical and modern machine learning models to estimate causal quantities. Specifically, we demonstrate training on neural networks and use common explainable AI methods to reveal the correct transfer of causal relations during our training procedure.
